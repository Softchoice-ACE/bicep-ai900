# Bicep Experiments with the AI-900 Learning Modules

This repo contains Bicep code to deploy Azure resources used throughout the Microsoft Learn AI-900 learning tracks.

This is first and foremost a learning exercise focused on Bicep and deployment stacks. I chose to use the AI-900 related resources as I am also working towards that certification, and I wanted to practice Bicep meaningful set of resources to deploy and experiment with.

This code is not complete, optimized, or polished. Consider it a work in progress and don't use it anywhere important. That said, the basic purpose is for it to deploy a basic set of a AI-900 learning resources to a resource group, and to be useful for that basic purpose.
